<section class="introduction-section">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a <strong>devoted</strong>, hard-working guy who is goal and detail oriented. Although I've been a successful chef for the past 17 years, I decided it was time for a career change. I am now a full-time student in Thinkful's Front-End Web Development
    Career Path program. Before committing to the <a href="http://thinkful.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFCB84; text-decoration: none">Thinkful</a> program, I dabbled in coding at several free online coding websites and have taken several college level coding courses.</p>
  <p> I have a beautiful wife and a 5 year old son, both of which are the most important parts of my life.</p>

<section class="location-section">
  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Idaho but have lived all over the western United States, with a stint on the gulf coast of Florida. My two favorite places to live are the wine country of California and in the shadows of the Tetons in Jackson, Wyoming.</p>
